            <p>A biogeochemical cycle, or more generally a cycle of matter, is the movement and transformation of
                chemical elements and compounds between living organisms, the atmosphere, and the Earth's crust. Major
                biogeochemical cycles include the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle. In each cycle,
                the chemical element or molecule is transformed and cycled by living organisms and through various
                geological forms and reservoirs, including the atmosphere, the soil and the oceans. It can be thought of
                as the pathway by which a chemical substance cycles (is turned over or moves through) the biotic
                compartment and the abiotic compartments of Earth. The biotic compartment is the biosphere and the
                abiotic compartments are the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere</p>
            <p>in the carbon cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants through photosynthesis, which
                converts it into organic compounds that are used by organisms for energy and growth. Carbon is then
                released back into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition. Additionally, carbon is stored
                in fossil fuels and is released into the atmosphere through human activities such as burning fossil
                fuels. In the nitrogen cycle, atmospheric nitrogen gas is converted by plants into usable forms such as
                ammonia and nitrates through the process of nitrogen fixation. These compounds can be used by other
                organisms, and nitrogen is returned to the atmosphere through denitrification and other processes. In
                the water cycle, the universal solvent water evaporates from land and oceans to form clouds in the
                atmosphere, and then precipitates back to different parts of the planet. Precipitation can seep into the
                ground and become part of groundwater systems used by plants and other organisms, or can runoff the
                surface to form lakes and rivers. Subterranean water can then seep into the ocean along with river
                discharges, rich with dissolved and particulate organic matter and other nutrients.</p>
            <p>There are biogeochemical cycles for many other elements, such as for oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorus,
                calcium, iron, sulfur, mercury and selenium. There are also cycles for molecules, such as water and
                silica. In addition there are macroscopic cycles such as the rock cycle, and human-induced cycles for
                synthetic compounds such as for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In some cycles there are geological
                reservoirs where substances can remain or be sequestered for long periods of time. Biogeochemical cycles
                involve the interaction of biological, geological, and chemical processes. Biological processes include
                the influence of microorganisms, which are critical drivers of biogeochemical cycling. Microorganisms
                have the ability to carry out wide ranges of metabolic processes essential for the cycling of nutrients
                and chemicals throughout global ecosystems. Without microorganisms many of these processes would not
                occur, with significant impact on the functioning of land and ocean ecosystems and the planet's
                biogeochemical cycles as a whole. Changes to cycles can impact human health. The cycles are
                interconnected and play important roles regulating climate, supporting the growth of plants,
                phytoplankton and other organisms, and maintaining the health of ecosystems generally. Human activities
                such as burning fossil fuels and using large amounts of fertilizer can disrupt cycles, contributing to
                climate change, pollution, and other environmental problems.</p>
            <p>Energy flows directionally through ecosystems, entering as sunlight (or inorganic molecules for
                chemoautotrophs) and leaving as heat during the many transfers between trophic levels. However, the
                matter that makes up living organisms is conserved and recycled. The six most common elements associated
                with organic molecules — carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur — take a variety of
                chemical forms and may exist for long periods in the atmosphere, on land, in water, or beneath the
                Earth's surface. Geologic processes, such as weathering, erosion, water drainage, and the subduction of
                the continental plates, all play a role in this recycling of materials. Because geology and chemistry
                have major roles in the study of this process, the recycling of inorganic matter between living
                organisms and their environment is called a biogeochemical cycle.The six aforementioned elements are
                used by organisms in a variety of ways. Hydrogen and oxygen are found in water and organic molecules,
                both of which are essential to life. Carbon is found in all organic molecules, whereas nitrogen is an
                important component of nucleic acids and proteins. Phosphorus is used to make nucleic acids and the
                phospholipids that comprise biological membranes. Sulfur is critical to the three-dimensional shape of
                proteins. The cycling of these elements is interconnected. For example, the movement of water is
                critical for leaching sulfur and phosphorus into rivers which can then flow into oceans. Minerals cycle
                through the biosphere between the biotic and abiotic components and from one organism to another.</p>
