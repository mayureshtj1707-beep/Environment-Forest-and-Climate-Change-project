            <p>An ecosystem (or ecological system) consists of all the organisms and the physical environment with which
                they interact.: 458  These biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and
                energy flows. Energy enters the system through photosynthesis and is incorporated into plant tissue. By
                feeding on plants and on one another, animals play an important role in the movement of matter and
                energy through the system. They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present. By
                breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate
                nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used
                by plants and microbes.Ecosystems are controlled by external and internal factors. External factors such
                as climate, parent material which forms the soil and topography, control the overall structure of an
                ecosystem but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. Internal factors are controlled, for
                example, by decomposition, root competition, shading, disturbance, succession, and the types of species
                present. While the resource inputs are generally controlled by external processes, the availability of
                these resources within the ecosystem is controlled by internal factors. Therefore, internal factors not
                only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them</p>
            <p>Ecosystems are dynamic entities—they are subject to periodic disturbances and are always in the process
                of recovering from some past disturbance. The tendency of an ecosystem to remain close to its
                equilibrium state, despite that disturbance, is termed its resistance. The capacity of a system to
                absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same function,
                structure, identity, and feedbacks is termed its ecological resilience. Ecosystems can be studied
                through a variety of approaches—theoretical studies, studies monitoring specific ecosystems over long
                periods of time, those that look at differences between ecosystems to elucidate how they work and direct
                manipulative experimentation. Biomes are general classes or categories of ecosystems. However, there is
                no clear distinction between biomes and ecosystems. Ecosystem classifications are specific kinds of
                ecological classifications that consider all four elements of the definition of ecosystems: a biotic
                component, an abiotic complex, the interactions between and within them, and the physical space they
                occupy. Biotic factors of the ecosystem are living things; such as plants, animals, and bacteria, while
                abiotic are non-living components; such as water, soil and atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Ecosystems provide a variety of goods and services upon which people depend. Ecosystem goods include the
                "tangible, material products" of ecosystem processes such as water, food, fuel, construction material,
                and medicinal plants. Ecosystem services, on the other hand, are generally "improvements in the
                condition or location of things of value". These include things like the maintenance of hydrological
                cycles, cleaning air and water, the maintenance of oxygen in the atmosphere, crop pollination and even
                things like beauty, inspiration and opportunities for research. Many ecosystems become degraded through
                human impacts, such as soil loss, air and water pollution, habitat fragmentation, water diversion, fire
                suppression, and introduced species and invasive species. These threats can lead to abrupt
                transformation of the ecosystem or to gradual disruption of biotic processes and degradation of abiotic
                conditions of the ecosystem. Once the original ecosystem has lost its defining features, it is
                considered "collapsed". Ecosystem restoration can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development
                Goals.</p>
            <p>Ecosystems are controlled by both external and internal factors. External factors, also called state
                factors, control the overall structure of an ecosystem and the way things work within it, but are not
                themselves influenced by the ecosystem. On broad geographic scales, climate is the factor that "most
                strongly determines ecosystem processes and structure".Climate determines the biome in which the
                ecosystem is embedded. Rainfall patterns and seasonal temperatures influence photosynthesis and thereby
                determine the amount of energy available to the ecosystem.Parent material determines the nature of the
                soil in an ecosystem, and influences the supply of mineral nutrients. Topography also controls ecosystem
                processes by affecting things like microclimate, soil development and the movement of water through a
                system. For example, ecosystems can be quite different if situated in a small depression on the
                landscape, versus one present on an adjacent steep hillside.Other external factors that play an
                important role in ecosystem functioning include time and potential biota, the organisms that are present
                in a region and could potentially occupy a particular site. Ecosystems in similar environments that are
                located in different parts of the world can end up doing things very differently simply because they
                have different pools of species present.  The introduction of non-native species can cause substantial
                shifts in ecosystem function.</p>
