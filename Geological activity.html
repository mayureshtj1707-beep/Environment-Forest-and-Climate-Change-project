            <p>Environmental geology, like hydrogeology, is an applied science concerned with the practical application
                of the principles of geology in the solving of environmental problems created by man. It is a
                multidisciplinary field that is closely related to engineering geology and, to a lesser extent, to
                environmental geography.[1] Each of these fields involves the study of the interaction of humans with
                the geologic environment, including the biosphere, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, and to some extent
                the atmosphere. In other words, environmental geology is the application of geological information to
                solve conflicts, minimizing possible adverse environmental degradation, or maximizing possible
                advantageous conditions resulting from the use of natural and modified environment. With an increasing
                world population and industrialization, the natural environment and resources are under high strain
                which puts them at the forefront of world issues. Environmental geology is on the rise with these issues
                as solutions are found by utilizing it.</p>
            <p>Planning out the usage of land is important to reduce the risk of natural hazards on humans and their
                infrastructure, but mostly to reduce negative human impact on the natural environment. The land, water,
                air, materials, and energy use are all critically impacted by human settlement and resource production.
                New sites must be found for mining, waste disposal, and industrial sites as these are all parts of an
                industrial society. Suitable sites are often difficult to find and get approval for as they must be
                shown to have barriers so contaminants are prevented from entering the environment.Site investigation in
                land use planning often includes at least two phases, an orientating investigation and a detailed
                investigation. The information in an orientating investigation is obtained through maps and other
                archived data. The information in a detailed investigation is obtained through a reconnaissance survey
                in the field and by reviewing the historic land use.</p>
            <p>Nonrenewable resources are only one type of resource with the other two being potentially renewable and
                perpetual. Nonrenewable resources, such as fossil fuels and metals, are finite, and therefore cannot be
                replenished during human lifetime, but are being depleted at a high rate. Due to their importance in
                many economies, this creates an issue as the world keeps developing the technologies used to exploit
                these resources. Some important roles of these nonrenewable resources are to heat homes, fuel cars, and
                build infrastructure. Environmental geology has been used to approach this issue with the sustainable
                development of recycling and reusing.Recycling is the process of collecting recyclable consumer and
                industrial materials and products and then sorting them so they can be processed into raw materials with
                the intention of then using the raw materials to create new products. Recycling and reusing can be done
                on an individual scale as well as an industrial scale. These practices maximize the usage of resources
                as much as possible all while minimizing waste. They also manage the industrial and domestic waste
                disposal as they reduce the amount of waste discharged into the global environment</p>
            <p>Since the Stone Age, when humans began mining for flint, they have been dependent on this practice, and
                the dependency on minerals continues to increase as society evolves. One of the downsides of mining is
                that it is restricted to areas where minerals are present and economically viable. Mining duration is
                also restrained as mineral resources are finite, so when a deposit is exhausted, mining in that location
                comes to an end.[1] Although modern mining and mineral activities utilize many ways to reduce negative
                environmental impacts, accidental releases can occur and the appropriate mitigation and prevention
                practices were not common in historical practices. Potentially harmful metals, other deposit
                constituents, and mineral processing chemicals or byproducts can contaminate the surrounding environment
                due to these situations.[6] Some common environmental impacts of mining are rock displacements that
                allow fine dust particles to seep into surface waters, the defacement of the local landscape, and the
                large amounts of waste with some being chemically reactive.[7] Ultimately, the impact that mining has on
                the environment is determined by many factors such as the size of the operation and the type of mining.
