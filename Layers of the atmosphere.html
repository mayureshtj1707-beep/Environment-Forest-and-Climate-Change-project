            <p>The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, known collectively as air, retained by Earth's gravity
                that surrounds the planet and forms its planetary atmosphere. The atmosphere of Earth creates pressure,
                absorbs most meteoroids and ultraviolet solar radiation, warms the surface through heat retention
                (greenhouse effect), allowing life and liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, and reduces
                temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).As of 2023, by mole
                fraction (i.e., by number of molecules), dry air contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon,
                0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases.[8] Air also contains a variable amount of water
                vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air composition,
                temperature, and atmospheric pressure vary with altitude. Within the atmosphere, air suitable for use in
                photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's
                troposphere.</p>
            <p>Earth's early atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. The atmosphere
                changed significantly over time, affected by many factors such as volcanism, life, and weathering.
                Recently, human activity has also contributed to atmospheric changes, such as global warming, ozone
                depletion and acid deposition.The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15×1018 kg,[9] three quarters of
                which is within about 11 km (6.8 mi; 36,000 ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner with
                increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. The Kármán line,
                at 100 km (62 mi) or 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and
                outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an
                altitude of around 120 km (75 mi). Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on
                characteristics such as temperature and composition. The study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes
                is called atmospheric science (aerology), and includes multiple subfields, such as climatology and
                atmospheric physics. Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.
                The study of historic atmosphere is called paleoclimatology.</p>
            <p>The three major constituents of Earth's atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accounts
                for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies
                significantly from around 10 ppm by mole fraction in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much
                as 5% by mole fraction in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are
                typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor).: 8  The remaining gases are often referred
                to as trace gases,among which are other greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
                oxide, and ozone. Besides argon, already mentioned, other noble gases, neon, helium, krypton, and xenon
                are also present. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Many substances
                of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an
                unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray,
                and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as
                chlorine (elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds
                such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial
                air pollution.</p>
            <p>The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (though it is so tenuous that some scientists
                consider it to be part of interplanetary space rather than part of the atmosphere). It extends from the
                thermopause (also known as the "exobase") at the top of the thermosphere to a poorly defined boundary
                with the solar wind and interplanetary medium. The altitude of the exobase varies from about 500
                kilometres (310 mi; 1,600,000 ft) to about 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) in times of higher incoming solar
                radiation.The upper limit varies depending on the definition. Various authorities consider it to end at
                about 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) or about 190,000 kilometres (120,000 mi)—about halfway to the moon,
                where the influence of Earth's gravity is about the same as radiation pressure from sunlight. The
                geocorona visible in the far ultraviolet (caused by neutral hydrogen) extends to at least 100,000
                kilometres (62,000 mi).This layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and
                several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms
                and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometres without colliding with one
                another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into
                space. These free-moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the
                magnetosphere or the solar wind. Every second, the Earth loses about 3 kg of hydrogen, 50 g of helium,
                and much smaller amounts of other constituents.</p>
