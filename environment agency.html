            <p>The Environment Agency (EA) is a non-departmental public body, established in 1996 and sponsored by the
                United Kingdom government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, with responsibilities
                relating to the protection and enhancement of the environment in England (and until 2013 also
                Wales).Based in Bristol, the Environment Agency is responsible for flood management, regulating land and
                water pollution, and conservation.The Environment Agency's stated purpose is, "to protect or enhance the
                environment, taken as a whole" so as to promote "the objective of achieving sustainable development"
                (taken from the Environment Act 1995, section 4). Protection of the environment relates to threats such
                as flood and pollution. The vision of the agency is of "a rich, healthy and diverse environment for
                present and future generations".The Environment Agency's remit covers almost the whole of England, about
                13 million hectares of land, 22,000 miles (35,000 km) of river and 3,100 miles (5,000 km) of coastline
                seawards to the three-mile limit which includes 2 million hectares of coastal waters.[3] In a sharing
                arrangement with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), it also exercises some of its
                functions over parts of the catchments of the River Tweed and the Border Esk which are, for the most
                part, in Scotland. Similarly, in an arrangement with NRW, political and operational areas are not
                coterminus. NRW staff exercise responsibility for parts of the River Dee in England and EA staff
                exercise operational responsibility for those parts of the River Severn catchment in Wales.</p>
            <p> The Environment Agency employs around 10,600 staff.[1] It is organised into eight directorates that
                report to the chief executive.There are two "policy and process" directorates. One deals with Flood and
                Coastal Risk Management and the other with Environment and Business. These are backed up by the Evidence
                directorate. The fourth directorate is a single Operations "delivery" unit, responsible for national
                services, and line management of all the regional and area staff.The remaining directorates are central
                shared service groups for Finance, Legal Services, Resources and Communications.In support of its aims,
                the agency acts as an operating authority, a regulatory authority and a licence authority.The agency is
                funded in part from the UK government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).
                Additional money is raised from the issuing of licences and permits such as abstraction licences, waste
                handler registrations, navigation rights and rod (fishing) licences.Funding for asset management and
                improvement and acquisition of flood risk management assets has traditionally come from local
                authorities via flood defence committees. This was then effectively repaid by central government in
                later years as part of the Formula Spending Share. In 2005 this was simplified by making a direct
                transfer from Treasury to the Environment Agency in the form of flood defence grant-in-aid.The
                Environment Agency's total funding in 2007–08 was £1,025 million, an increase of £23 million on 2006–07.
                Of that total, £629 million (61 per cent) was provided in the form of 'flood defence grant-in-aid' from
                government (£578 million for England and £50 million for Wales).</p>
            <p>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has the lead sponsorship responsibility
                for the Environment Agency as a whole and is responsible for the appointment of the chairman and the
                Environment Agency board.In addition the Secretary of State is responsible for overall policy on the
                environment and sustainable development within which the agency undertakes its work; the setting of
                objectives for the agency's functions and its contribution to sustainable development; the approval of
                its budget and payment of government grant to the agency for its activities in England and approval of
                its regulatory and charging regimes. Its chief executive is Sir James Bevan.Sir Philip Dilley resigned
                as chairman on 11 January 2016, with Emma Howard Boyd becoming acting chair.[7] Emma Howard Boyd took up
                the post of chair formally on 19 September 2016.The Environment Agency was created by the Environment
                Act 1995, and came into existence on 1 April 1996. It had responsibility for the whole of England and
                Wales but with specifically designated border arrangements with Scotland covering the catchment of the
                River Tweed. It took over the roles and responsibilities of the National Rivers Authority (NRA), Her
                Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) and the waste regulation authorities in England and Wales
                including the London Waste Regulation Authority (LWRA). All of the predecessor bodies were disbanded and
                the local authorities relinquished their waste regulatory role. At the same time, the agency took
                responsibility for issuing flood warnings to the public, a role previously held by the police.</p>
            <p>In 2010 a new national headquarters for the agency was opened at Horizon House in Deanery Road, Bristol.
                The building, which was designed by Alec French Architects, won the Building Research Establishment
                Environmental Assessment (BREEAM) Award for its environmentally friendly construction and operation
                which includes the use of sustainable materials, natural ventilation and cooling, photoelectric panels
                and rainwater harvesting.On 24 April 2013, Horizon House suffered a fire leading to its closure for
                several weeks.An investigation into the fire found it was that result of workmen accidentally igniting
                the environmentally friendly cavity wall insulation on the ground floor and due to the design of the
                upward airflow the fire spread quickly in the inside of the wall leading to substantial smoke damage
                throughout.The building was quickly evacuated and the fire under control in under an hour. The resulting
                internal document proposed additional standards for the handling of materials that offer environmental
                advantages but may be considered more susceptible to ignition.</p>
