            <p>Environmental Impact assessment (EIA) is the assessment of the environmental consequences of a plan,
                policy, program, or actual projects prior to the decision to move forward with the proposed action. In
                this context, the term "environmental impact assessment" is usually used when applied to actual projects
                by individuals or companies and the term "strategic environmental assessment" (SEA) applies to policies,
                plans and programmes most often proposed by organs of state.It is a tool of environmental management
                forming a part of project approval and decision-making. Environmental assessments may be governed by
                rules of administrative procedure regarding public participation and documentation of decision making,
                and may be subject to judicial review.</p>
            <p> The purpose of the assessment is to ensure that decision-makers consider the environmental impacts when
                deciding whether or not to proceed with a project. The International Association for Impact Assessment
                (IAIA) defines an environmental impact assessment as "the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating
                and mitigating the biophysical, social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to
                major decisions being taken and commitments made". EIAs are unique in that they do not require adherence
                to a predetermined environmental outcome, but rather they require decision-makers to account for
                environmental values in their decisions and to justify those decisions in light of detailed
                environmental studies and public comments on the potential environmental impacts.Environmental Impact
                Assessments commenced in the 1960s, as part of increasing environmental awareness. An EIA is prepared to
                estimate the effects of a proposed development or construction project. EIA provides technical
                evaluations that are intended to contribute to more objective decision making. In the United States, EIA
                obtained formal status in 1969, with the enactment of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). EIAs
                have been used increasingly around the world. The number of environmental assessments filed every year
                "has vastly overtaken the number of more rigorous Environmental Impact Statements (EIS). An
                environmental assessment is mini-Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) designed to provide sufficient
                information to allow the agency to decide whether the preparation of a full-blown Environmental Impact
                Statement (EIS) is necessary.</p>
            <p>The history of EIA in Australia could be linked to the enactment of the U.S. National Environment Policy
                Act (NEPA) in 1970, which made the preparation of environmental impact statements a requirement. In
                Australia, one might say that the EIA procedures were introduced at a State Level prior to that of the
                Commonwealth (Federal), with a majority of the states having divergent views to the Commonwealth. One of
                the pioneering states was New South Wales, whose State Pollution Control Commission issued EIA
                guidelines in 1974. At a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level, this was followed by passing of the
                Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (Cth) in 1974. The Environment Protection and
                Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act) superseded the Environment Protection (Impact of
                Proposals) Act 1974 (Cth) and is the current central piece for EIA in Australia on a Commonwealth (i.e.
                Federal) level. An important point to note is that this federal legislation does not override the
                validity of the States or Territories environmental and development assessments and approvals; rather
                the EPBC Act runs as a parallel to the State/Territory Systems. Overlap between federal and state
                requirements is addressed via bilateral agreements or one-off accreditation of state processes, as
                provided for in the EPBC Act</p>
            <p>In addition to this, the EPBC Act aims at providing a streamlined national assessment and approval
                process for activities. These activities could be by the Commonwealth, or its agents, anywhere in the
                world or activities on Commonwealth land; and activities that are listed as having a 'significant
                impact' on matters of 'national environment significance'.The EPBC Act comes into play when a person (a
                proponent) wants an action (often called "a proposal" or "a project") assessed for environmental impacts
                under the EPBC Act, he or she must refer the project to the Department of the Environment and Energy
                (Commonwealth). This referral is then released to the public and the relevant state, territory and
                Commonwealth ministers, for comment on whether the project is likely to have a significant impact on
                matters of national environmental significance.The Department of the Environment and Energy assess the
                process and makes recommendation to the minister or the delegate for the feasibility. The final
                discretion on the decision remains of the minister, which is not solely based on matters of national
                environmental significance but also on the consideration of social and economic impact of the
                project.The Australian Government Minister for the Environment and Energy cannot intervene in a proposal
                if it has no significant impact on one of the eight matters of national environmental significance,
                regardless of any other undesirable environmental impacts. This is primarily due to the division of
                powers between the states and the Federal government, and the Australian Government environment minister
                not being able to overturn a state decision.[citation needed There are strict civil and criminal
                penalties for the breach of EPBC Act. Depending on the kind of breach, civil penalty (maximum) may go up
                to $550,000 for an individual and $5.5 million for a body corporate, or for criminal penalty (maximum)
                of seven years imprisonment and/or penalty of $46,200</p>
