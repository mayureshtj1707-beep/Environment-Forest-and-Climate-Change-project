            <p>Microorganisms are the oldest form of life on Earth and can be found everywhere, from the depths of the
                ocean to forest floors, and even outer space and beyond. Environmental microbiology is the study of how
                microbes interact with the environment and each other, including their effects on the landscape, the
                spread of viruses and bacteria, the distribution of algae, fungi and parasitical organisms and the
                associated implications for human health and the environment. Environmental microbiology also researches
                how microbes can be used to solve global problems. For example, an environmental microbiologist may
                study the use of microbes to clean up oil spills or other contaminated areas or use organisms that
                thrive in certain elements to create medicines, topical sunscreens and water purification solutions.
                Researchers across the U.S. have identified a common marine microbe that can kill red tide, a harmful
                algae bloom that’s been on the rise in recent years. Scientists here at UF even found a way to
                synthesize shinorine from a microbe, enabling the production of safer and more environmentally friendly
                sunscreens.</p>
            <p>Our Graduate Certificate in Environmental Microbiology is the first program of its kind and includes
                courses that provide a comprehensive understanding of microbes as they relate to environments, both
                around the world and in space. Some of the courses you can take include: MCB 5705 – Astrobiology:
                Examine biosphere formation, microbe-driven biogeochemistry, microbe adaptation to extreme environments,
                planetary habitability and microbiology within the International Space Station.
                MCB 6407 – Prokaryotic Cell Structure and Function
                MCB 6656 – Environmental Microbiology: Explore microorganisms in the environment, including occurrence,
                abundance and distribution. Learn the current research methodologies to decipher microbial processes and
                activities, marine microbial ecology, microbial interactions with the environment and practices of
                applied environmental microbiology.

            <p>The initial scientific focus of the field of environmental microbiology was on water quality and the fate
                of pathogens in the environment in the context of protection of public health. The roots for water
                quality go back to the turn of the twentieth century, when the treatment of water supplies by filtration
                and disinfection resulted in a dramatic decrease in the incidence of typhoid fever and cholera.
                Application of these processes throughout the developed world has essentially eliminated waterborne
                bacterial disease except when treatment failures occur. Until the 1960s, it was thought that threats
                from waterborne disease had been eliminated. However, case studies began to accumulate suggesting that
                other agents, such as viruses and protozoa, were more resistant to disinfection than enteric bacteria.
            </p>
            <p>This concern became a reality with the discovery of waterborne outbreaks caused by the protozoan parasite
                Giardia and by Norovirus, both of which were found in disinfected drinking water. Water quality
                continues to be a major focus in environmental microbiology because new waterborne pathogens continue to
                emerge. One of the best documented and largest outbreaks occurred in 1993 when more than 400,000 people
                became ill and over 100 died in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during a waterborne outbreak caused by the
                protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium. Table 1.1 lists many of the important pathogens that have emerged in
                the past 30 years. Even more worrisome, recent studies suggest that 10 to 50% of diarrhea-associated
                illness is caused by waterborne microbial agents we have yet to identify.Pathogens in our food supply is
                a second area of immense concern. One of the difficult questions facing the food industry is that of
                importation of vegetables and fruits. On the one hand, there is consumer demand for a wide variety of
                high quality imported produce; on the other hand, there is an increased danger of importing pathogens
                along with the produce. One example is the protozoan pathogen Cyclospora. This organism gained notoriety
                as the causative agent of a disease outbreak affecting approximately 1000 people in the United States
                between early May and mid-July 1996. The Cyclospora outbreak was due to consumption of raspberries
                imported from Guatemala. Foodborne outbreaks have resulted in major recalls of various foods (see
                Information Box 1.1 ). These examples illustrate the types of questions that are addressed by
                environmental microbiologists. How do pathogens survive in the environment, and how can they be detected
                and eliminated rapidly and economically to allow both protection of human health and rapid consumption
                of fresh produce? Determining the presence and significance of pathogenic organisms in food, water, and
                air supplies is a challenge that will keep environmental microbiologists occupied in the coming decades.
