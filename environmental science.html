      <p>Environmental science is an interdisciplinary academic field that integrates physics, biology, and geography
        (including ecology, chemistry, plant science, zoology, mineralogy, oceanography, limnology, soil science,
        geology and physical geography, and atmospheric science) to the study of the environment, and the solution of
        environmental problems. Environmental science emerged from the fields of natural history and medicine during the
        Enlightenment. Today it provides an integrated, quantitative, and interdisciplinary approach to the study of
        environmental systems.Environmental studies incorporates more of the social sciences for understanding human
        relationships, perceptions and policies towards the environment. Environmental engineering focuses on design and
        technology for improving environmental quality in every aspect.Environmental scientists seek to understand the
        earth's physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes, and to use that knowledge to understand how
        issues such as alternative energy systems, pollution control and mitigation, natural resource management, and
        the effects of global warming and climate change influence and affect the natural systems and processes of
        earth. Environmental issues almost always include an interaction of physical, chemical, and biological
        processes.</p>
      <p> Environmental scientists bring a systems approach to the analysis of environmental problems. Key elements of
        an effective environmental scientist include the ability to relate space, and time relationships as well as
        quantitative analysis. Environmental science came alive as a substantive, active field of scientific
        investigation in the 1960s and 1970s driven by the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to analyze complex
        environmental problems, the arrival of substantive environmental laws requiring specific environmental protocols
        of investigation and the growing public awareness of a need for action in addressing environmental problems.
        Events that spurred this development included the publication of Rachel Carson's landmark environmental book
        Silent Spring along with major environmental issues becoming very public, such as the 1969 Santa Barbara oil
        spill, and the Cuyahoga River of Cleveland, Ohio, "catching fire" (also in 1969), and helped increase the
        visibility of environmental issues and create this new field of study.</p>
      <p>Historical concern for environmental issues is well documented in archives around the world. Ancient
        civilizations were mainly concerned with what is now known as environmental science insofar as it related to
        agriculture and natural resources. Scholars believe that early interest in the environment began around 6000 BCE
        when ancient civilizations in Israel and Jordan collapsed due to deforestation. As a result, in 2700 BCE the
        first legislation limiting deforestation was established in Mesopotamia. Two hundred years later, in 2500 BCE, a
        community residing in the Indus River Valley observed the nearby river system in order to improve sanitation.
        This involved manipulating the flow of water to account for public health. In the Western Hemisphere, numerous
        ancient Central American city-states collapsed around 1500 BCE due to soil erosion from intensive agriculture.
        Those remaining from these civilizations took greater attention to the impact of farming practices on the
        sustainability of the land and its stable food production. Furthermore, in 1450 BCE the Minoan civilization on
        the Greek island of Crete declined due to deforestation and the resulting environmental degradation of natural
        resources. Pliny the Elder somewhat addressed the environmental concerns of ancient civilizations in the text
        Naturalis Historia, written between 77 and 79 ACE, which provided an overview of many related subsets of the
        discipline.</p>
      <p>In 1735, the concept of binomial nomenclature is introduced by Carolus Linnaeus as a way to classify all living
        organisms, influenced by earlier works of Aristotle. His text, Systema Naturae, represents one of the earliest
        culminations of knowledge on the subject, providing a means to identify different species based partially on how
        they interact with their environment. In the 1820s, scientists were studying the properties of gases,
        particularly those in the Earth's atmosphere and their interactions with heat from the Sun. Later that century,
        studies suggested that the Earth had experienced an Ice Age and that warming of the Earth was partially due to
        what are now known as greenhouse gases (GHG).The greenhouse effect was introduced, although climate science was
        not yet recognized as an important topic in environmental science due to minimal industrialization and lower
        rates of greenhouse gas emissions at the time.In the 1900s, the discipline of environmental science as it is
        known today began to take shape. The century is marked by significant research, literature, and international
        cooperation in the field.</p>
