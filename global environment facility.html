            <p>The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is a multilateral environmental fund that provides grants and
                blended finance for projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land
                degradation, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), mercury, sustainable forest management, food
                security, and sustainable cities in developing countries. It is the largest source of multilateral
                funding for biodiversity globally, and distributes more than $1 billion a year on average to address
                inter-related environmental challenges.The GEF was established ahead of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and
                includes 184 countries in partnership with international institutions, civil society organizations, and
                the private sector. It supports country-driven sustainable development initiatives in developing
                countries that generate global environmental benefits. To date, the GEF has provided more than $22
                billion in grants and mobilized another $120 billion in co-financing for more than 5,200 projects and
                programs. Through its Small Grants Programme (SGP), the GEF has provided support to nearly 27,000 civil
                society and community initiatives in 136 countries.[1] In June 2022, donors to the GEF pledged a record
                $5.33 billion in support for its latest four-year replenishment cycle, which runs until June 2026.</p>
            <p>The GEF has a governing structure organized around an Assembly, the Council, the Secretariat, 18
                Agencies, a Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP), and the Independent Evaluation Office.The
                GEF Assembly is composed of all 184 member countries,or Participants. It meets every three to four years
                at the ministerial level to review general policies; review and evaluate the GEF's operation based on
                reports submitted to Council; review the membership of the Facility; and consider, for approval by
                consensus, amendments to the Instrument for the Establishment of the Restructured GEF on the basis of
                recommendations by the Council. Ministers and high-level government delegations of all GEF member
                countries take part in the meetings. The Assembly combines plenary meetings and high-level panels,
                exhibits, side events, and GEF project site visits. Prominent environmentalists, parliamentarians,
                business leaders, scientists, and NGO leaders discuss global environmental challenges within the context
                of sustainable development and other international development goals.The GEF Council is the main
                governing body of the GEF. It comprises 32 members appointed by constituencies of GEF member countries
                (14 from developed countries, 16 from developing countries and 2 from economies in transition). Council
                Members rotate every three years or until the constituency appoints a new Member. The Council, which
                meets twice annually, develops, adopts, and evaluates the operational policies and programs for
                GEF-financed activities. It also reviews and approves the work program (projects submitted for
                approval), making decisions by consensus.The GEF Secretariat is based in Washington, D.C., and reports
                directly to the GEF Council and Assembly, ensuring that their decisions are translated into effective
                actions. The Secretariat coordinates the formulation of projects included in the work programs, oversees
                its implementation, and makes certain that operational strategy and policies are followed. The CEO and
                Chairperson, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez heads the Secretariat.
            </p>
            <p>The Global Environment Facility was established in October 1991 under the chairmanship of Mohamed
                El-Ashry as a $1 billion pilot program in the World Bank to enable developing countries to take action
                on environmental challenges and to promote sustainable development. The GEF would provide new and
                additional grants and concessional funding to cover the "incremental" or additional costs associated
                with transforming a project with national benefits into one with global environmental benefits.The
                United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the World Bank were
                the three initial partners implementing GEF projects.In 1992, at the Rio Earth Summit, the GEF was
                restructured and established as a permanent, separate institution. The decision to make the GEF an
                independent organization enhanced the involvement of developing countries in the decision-making process
                and in implementation of the projects. Since 1994, the World Bank has served as the Trustee of the GEF
                Trust Fund and provides administrative services.As part of the restructuring, the GEF was entrusted to
                become the financial mechanism for both the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN Framework
                Convention on Climate Change. In partnership with The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
                Ozone Layer, the GEF started funding projects that enable the Russian Federation and nations in Eastern
                Europe and Central Asia to phase out their use of ozone-destroying chemicals.
