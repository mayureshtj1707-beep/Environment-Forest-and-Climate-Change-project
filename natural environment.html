            <p>The natural environment or natural world encompasses all living and non-living things occurring
                naturally, meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to Earth or some parts of
                Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural
                resources that affect human survival and economic activity.The concept of the natural environment can be
                distinguished as components:Complete ecological units that function as natural systems without massive
                civilized human intervention, including all vegetation, microorganisms, soil, rocks, the atmosphere, and
                natural phenomena that occur within their boundaries and their nature.Universal natural resources and
                physical phenomena that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as energy,
                radiation, electric charge, and magnetism, not originating from civilized human actions.</p>
            <p> In contrast to the natural environment is the built environment. Built environments are where humans
                have fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion, the
                natural environment is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem less
                extreme, such as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert, the modified environment
                becomes an artificial one. Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for
                themselves, they are not human, hence beaver dams, and the works of mound-building termites, are thought
                of as natural.People cannot find absolutely natural environments on Earth, and naturalness usually
                varies in a continuum, from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. The massive
                environmental changes of humanity in the Anthropocene have fundamentally effected all natural
                environments: including from climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution from plastic and other
                chemicals in the air and water. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of
                an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform. If, for instance, in an
                agricultural field, the mineralogic composition and the structure of its soil are similar to those of an
                undisturbed forest soil, but the structure is quite different.</p>
            <p>Earth science generally recognizes four spheres, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and
                the biosphere as correspondent to rocks, water, air, and life respectively. Some scientists include as
                part of the spheres of the Earth, the cryosphere (corresponding to ice) as a distinct portion of the
                hydrosphere, as well as the pedosphere (to soil) as an active and intermixed sphere. Earth science (also
                known as geoscience, the geographical sciences or the Earth Sciences), is an all-embracing term for the
                sciences related to the planet Earth.[4] There are four major disciplines in earth sciences, namely
                geography, geology, geophysics and geodesy. These major disciplines use physics, chemistry, biology,
                chronology and mathematics to build a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the principal areas
                or spheres of Earth.The Earth's crust, or lithosphere, is the outermost solid surface of the planet and
                is chemically and mechanically different from underlying mantle. It has been generated greatly by
                igneous processes in which magma cools and solidifies to form solid rock. Beneath the lithosphere lies
                the mantle which is heated by the decay of radioactive elements. The mantle though solid is in a state
                of rheic convection. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The
                resulting process is known as plate tectonics. Volcanoes result primarily from the melting of subducted
                crust material or of rising mantle at mid-ocean ridges and mantle plumes.</p>
            <p>Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or
                recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In
                some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the
                last ice age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with
                sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.A pond is a body of standing water, either natural
                or human-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of human-made bodies of water are
                classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed
                for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are
                distinguished from streams by their current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds
                and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind-driven currents. These features
                distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.</p>
