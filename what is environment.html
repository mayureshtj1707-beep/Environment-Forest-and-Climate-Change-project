      <p>Environment means what surrounds us. It may be living or non-living things. It includes physical, chemical and
        other natural forces. Living things live in their environment. They constantly interact with it and adapt
        themselves to conditions in their environment. In the environment there are different interactions between
        animals, plants, soil, water, and other living and non-living things.The word environment is used to talk about
        many things. People in different fields of knowledge use the word environment differently. Electromagnetic
        environment is radio waves and other electromagnetic radiation and magnetic fields. The environment of a galaxy
        may mean the interstellar medium, or it may mean other nearby galaxies.</p>
      <p> In psychology and medicine, a person's environment is the people, physical things and places that the person
        lives with. The environment affects the growth and development of the person. It may affect the person's
        behavior, body and mind.The conditions of living organisms in an environment are affected by the weather and
        climate changes in the environment. They are also greatly affected by other living things. in biology and
        ecology, the environment is all of the natural materials and living things, If those things are natural, it is a
        natural environment.Environment includes the living and non-living things that an organism interacts with, or
        has an effect on it. Living elements that an organism interacts with are known as biotic elements: animals,
        plants, etc. Abiotic elements are non living things which include air, water, sunlight etc. Studying the
        environment means studying the relationships among these various things.</p>
      <p>An example of interactions between non-living and living things is plants getting their minerals from the soil
        and making food using sunlight. Predation, an organism eating another, is an example of interaction between
        living things.Environmentalists think we should protect the natural environment, to keep it safe. Things in the
        natural environment that we value are called natural resources. For example; fish, insects, and forests. These
        are renewable resources because they come backnaturally when we use them. Non-renewable resources are important
        things in the environment that are limited for example, ores and fossil fuels after a few thousand years. Some
        things in the natural environment can kill people, such as lightning. Ecological units which are natural systems
        without much human interference. These include all vegetation, microorganisms, soil, rocks, atmosphere, and
        natural events.Universal natural resources and physical phenomenon which lack clear-cut boundaries. These
        include climate, air, water, energy, radiation, electric charge, and magnetism. </p> 
       <p>Descending from the Middle French preposition environ “around,” environment , in its most basic meaning, is
        “that which surrounds.” When preceded by the and unmodified, it usually refers to the natural world (“please
        don’t litter if you care about the environment”). In a less physical, more extended sense, it may signify the
        circumstances and conditions that make up everyday life (“He grew up in a loving environment.”) The word may
        also be applied in highly specialized ways, denoting, for example, “the position of a linguistic element” (“how
        g gets pronounced in Italian depends upon its phonetic environment”) or “a computer interface from which various
        tasks can be performed” (“the app works in varied environments").Light and noise pollution will always be
        something to contend with when enjoying any movie outdoors, so aim for a more secluded, dark environment to get
        the most out of your projector.Perhaps his most famous paintings from the 1960s feature entire environments
        built around giant signs — Standard gas stations, Norm’s diners, 20th Century Fox movie studios — all done up in
        flag-waving red, white and blue.Others, such as designer Jane Wade, are transfixed by the very act of movement,
        of transporting oneself from their personal safe haven to often banal corporate environments.</p>
